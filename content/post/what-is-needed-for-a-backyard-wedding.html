        <h3>Are The Wedding Bells Finally Ringing?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>No one will even know. Make outstanding centerpieces that smell as good as they look. With the nature providing you with the best backdrop, adding a fanciful decor, some imaginative lighting, and formal carpeting is what is needed for a backyard tent wedding to truly standout among the rest.</p>
        <h3>One Thing You Should Consider When Planning The Intimate Backyard Wedding Of Your Dreams Is Your Physical Space.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>When you choose to have a backyard wedding, you’re building everything from the ground up. Sheofsky says, the fire department will require you to pull permits for any party tents and open flame, but the vendors you hire will be able to assist in identifying these needs and pulling the permits. depending on your county&#039;s rules, your local fire department may send out a fire marshal to visit the tent once it&#039;s setup for your wedding. Make them feel part of the ceremony with a special flower crown or decorated leash.</p>
        <h3>Take Advantage Of All The Backyard Has To Offer.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hire a baker to do your wedding cake! Generally, the earlier the wedding the less formal the dress code. If you prefer, buy a fake wedding cake and use sheet cake in the kitchen to be cut up and served to guests;</p>
        <h3>In Order To Prevent Potential Catastrophe From Ruining Your Big Day, Keep A Copy Of Your House&#039;s Blueprints On Hand In.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Bring a jacket to a 6 pm wedding. Have fun with your ceremony setting. If you’ve read our handy wedding checklist before, you’d know that we recommend getting a general sense of your budget and guest list before you decide on your venue (aka the backyard).</p>
