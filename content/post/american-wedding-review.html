    <p><strong>Awasome American Wedding Review 2022</strong>. ★★★★ rewatched by larissa 29 may 2022. The biggest surprise in “american wedding” is the fact that the film really belongs to scott’s character, stifler, as he tries to execute a plot to deflower michelle’s maid of honor, her sexy sister, cadence (january jones).</p>

        <p>From formal receptions to bachelor parties to casual conversations at home, alcohol flows freely at this wedding. There is no joke too low for the movie to stoop to, no melodrama too broad, no human weakness too pitiful to satirize, and yet, because the filmmakers and the actors like these characters and wish them well and want them to somehow live happily ever after, all is redeemed.</p>
